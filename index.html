                        <h2>London, UK</h2>
                        <p>My dad was in the air force for 20 years, he was stationed in Saudia Arabia, my mom was at a military base in England when I was born. I was actually born in an ambulance on the way to the hospital, and have dual citizenship. We lived in England for about a year before they moved back to the US and lived in Texas.</p>

                        <h2>Wichita Falls, TX</h2>
                        <p>After we moved back to the states, we moved to Texas and lived there for about 5 years, I don't have many memories of that time. I just know we lived directly across the street from my elementary school, and my friend Nick lived right up the street.</p>

                        <h2>Foley, MO</h2>
                        <p>We decided to move back up to Missouri when I was five to be closer to our family. My uncle was a real estate agent at the time and found us a house out in the middle of nowhere, they still live at that house. I moved away from there when i was 21 years old.</p>

                        <h2>Wentzville, MO</h2>
                        <p>I eventually rented an apartment at Peine Lakes apartments where I lived for a couple of years. I loved living in Wentzville and being so close to everything for the first time in my life. When I lived in Foley it would usually take 15 minutes or more to get to any type of store.</p>

                        <h2>Lake St. Louis, MO</h2>
                        <p>In 2015 I rented out my best friends basement, where I got to spend a lot of time with him and his family. I got to learn a lot about what a Godly family looks like from him, his wife, and their two boys. I learned a lot about raising children, before I moved in with them I had never even changed a diaper. Also while living with them I met my future wife to be at our church. We eventually got engaged and married, where I then moved into my wifes house in O'fallon.</p>

                        <h2>O'Fallon, MO</h2>
                        <p>My wife, Kayla and I, got married last year in May. She had bought this home a couple years previously so it made it easy to already have a place to move into. It's a cozy little home, we have two dogs and wish we had a big fenced in back yard. For right now though this home will do until we decide to start having children.</p>
